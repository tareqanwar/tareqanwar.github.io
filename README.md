## Hello, GitHub!

Thanks for checking out [my website](https://tareqanwar.com/). Here's what's going on:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) graciously hosts my site.
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) powers my DNS (and SSL ftw).
- Canvas to add the color changer circle
- [Brain.JS](https://brain.js.org/) to change the text color based on background color

There's not much more to it.
